# Real-Time Location Tracking Application

## Overview

This project is a real-time location tracking application built using Node.js, Socket.io, and Leaflet. The application allows multiple users to share their geographical locations in real-time, visualizing their positions on a dynamic map. Users can see each other's markers and receive updates whenever their location changes, making it ideal for collaborative scenarios or for tracking friends and family.

## Features

- **Real-Time Location Sharing**: Users can share their locations with others in real-time.
- **Dynamic Map Visualization**: Leveraging Leaflet.js, the application displays user locations on an interactive map.
- **Marker Clustering**: Utilizes Leaflet MarkerCluster to handle multiple markers efficiently, enhancing the user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The web application is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across various devices (desktop and mobile).
- **Location Update Handling**: Users are updated on each otherâ€™s movements, with real-time updates sent every 5 seconds.

## Technologies Used
