# RealTimeTracking
This project is a real-time location tracking application built using Node.js, Socket.io, and Leaflet. The application allows multiple users to share their geographical locations in real-time, visualizing their positions on a dynamic map. Users can see each other's markers and receive updates whenever their location changes.
